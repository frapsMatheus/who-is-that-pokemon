# Who's That Pokémon?  

This project is a mobile game inspired by the classic segment from the Pokémon anime, where players try to guess which Pokémon is hidden behind a silhouette.  

The app shows a shadowed Pokémon, and the player must guess its name. Once answered, the silhouette is revealed along with the correct Pokémon.  

The goal of this project is not only to recreate the nostalgic **“Who’s That Pokémon?”** experience, but also to serve as a playground for testing the **modern Android development stack**.
